# Knockback

Minecraft 1.21 introduced a significant change to Blast Protection mechanics, removing the 60% cap on knockback resistance. This change allows knockback resistance to exceed 100%, which effectively breaks crystal PvP. As a result, many PvP-based servers have been forced to stick with version 1.20.6.

This plugin aims to restore pre-1.21 blast protection mechanics for end crystals and respawn anchors by maintaining the original 60% knockback reduction cap, allowing you to upgrade your server to 1.21+ without compromising crystal PvP.
