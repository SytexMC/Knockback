# Knockback

In Minecraft versions prior to 1.21, blast protection was capped at 4 enchantment levels (equivalent to 60% knockback reduction). In 1.21+, this cap has been removed, allowing for knockback reduction beyond the original 60% limit. As a result, many crystal PvP servers have been forced to remain on version 1.20.6 to preserve their core gameplay experience. This plugin exists to solve this issue, allowing servers to upgrade to 1.21+ while maintaining the traditional crystal PvP mechanics their players are used to.
